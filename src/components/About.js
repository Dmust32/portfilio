        About Me
        <p>I'm a California kid with a passion for web development. My main weapons of choice are React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. I am always looking to add more tools to my arsenal. I'm a huge soccer fan, Go Royals! When I'm not working I can be found in my fish room tending to my 9 aquariums, gargoyle gecko and ball python. </p>
